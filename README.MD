The lua script allows to bind DAO additional quickbar buttons that the BioWare developers did not provide for to a Logitech G600 mouse.  
This script is inserted into the Logitech Gaming Software Dragon Age Origins game profile in the Scripts dropdown menu with Automatic Game Detection enabled.  
Further, it is stored in a regular XML profile. Haven't tried G Hub.

The coordinates calculation was carried out for the mod [FtG Quickbar - Center and Multi Rows](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/2784)
with [Configuration Utility for FtG Quickbar v1.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/2784?tab=files) and screen resolution 1920x1080  

&emsp;Quickbar  
&emsp;&emsp;Maximum quickbar rows: 2  
&emsp;&emsp;• Align: center&emsp;|&emsp;Ragged row align: Center (left bias)  
&emsp;&emsp;✓ Wrap quickslots: Right&emsp;|&emsp;8 spaces maximum

&emsp;Effect bar  
&emsp;&emsp;• Always expanded

For extra binds, the slots of the top panel of the quickbar are used above the in-game binds 1-E.  
On the G7 button the highlighting of the names of the environment is implemented ("Tab" toggled).  
On the button G8 - autorun ("W" toggled).  
In addition mouse button G18 instant buffs rogue poisons from top panel F1-F5 to bottom panel N1-N5
and button G20 button buffs all previous and rarer poisons F1-F8, N1-N8.

The code can be rewritten for other binds and coordinates.
